These features of modern programming systems are among the most difficult to implement efficiently, even individually. A new implementation of the Smalltalk-80 system, hosted on a small microprocessor-based computer, achieves high performance while retaining complete (object code) compatibility with existing implementations. This paper discusses the most significant optimization techniques developed over the course of the project, many of which are applicable to other languages. The key idea is to represent certain runtime state (both code and data) in more than one form, and to convert between forms when needed.},

  abstract = {We have developed and implemented techniques that double the performance of dynamically-typed object-oriented languages. Our SELF implementation runs twice as fast as the fastest Smalltalk implementation, despite SELF's lack of classes and explicit variables. To compensate for the absence of classes, our system uses implementation-level maps to transparently group objects cloned from the same prototype, providing data type information and eliminating the apparent space overhead for prototype-based systems. To compensate for dynamic typing, user-defined control structures, and the lack of explicit variables, our system dynamically compiles multiple versions of a source method, each customized according to its receiver's map. Within each version the type of the receiver is fixed, and thus the compiler can statically bind and inline all messages sent to self. Message splitting and type prediction extract and preserve even more static type information, allowing the compiler to inline many other messages. Inlining dramatically improves performance and eliminates the need to hard-wire low-level methods such as +,==, and ifTrue:. Despite inlining and other optimizations, our system still supports interactive programming environments. The system traverses internal dependency lists to invalidate all compiled methods affected by a programming change. The debugger reconstructs inlined stack frames from compiler-generated debugging information, making inlining invisible to the SELF programmer.},

  abstract = {Polymorphic inline caches (PICs) provide a new way to reduce the overhead of polymorphic message sends by extending inline caches to include more than one cached lookup result per call site. For a set of typical object-oriented SELF programs, PICs achieve a median speedup of 11%. As an important side effect, PICs collect type information by recording all of the receiver types actually used at a given call site. The compiler can exploit this type information to generate better code when recompiling a method. An experimental version of such a system achieves a median speedup of 27% for our set of SELF programs, reducing the number of non-inlined message sends by a factor of two. Implementations of dynamically-typed object-oriented languages have been limited by the paucity of type information available to the compiler. The abundance of the type information provided by PICs suggests a new compilation approach for these languages, adaptive compilation . Such compilers may succeed in generating very efficient code for the time-critical parts of a program without incurring distracting compilation pauses.},

  abstract = {An interpreter can spend a significant part of its execution time on accessing arguments of virtual machine instructions. This paper explores two methods to reduce this overhead for virtual stack machines by caching top-of-stack values in (real machine) registers. The dynamic method is based on having, for every possible state of the cache, one specialized version of the whole interpreter; the execution of an instruction usually changes the state of the cache and the next instruction is executed in the version corresponding to the new state. In the static method a state machine that keeps track of the cache state is added to the compiler. Common instructions exist in specialized versions for several states, but it is not necessary to have a version of every instruction for every cache state. Stack manipulation instructions are optimized away.},

  abstract = {Truffle is a Java-based framework for developing high-performance language runtimes. Language implementers aiming at developing new runtimes have to design all the runtime mechanisms for managing dynamically typed objects from scratch. This not only leads to potential code duplication, but also impacts the actual time needed to develop a fully-fledged runtime. In this paper we address this issue by introducing a common object storage model (OSM) for Truffle that can be used by language implementers to develop new runtimes. The OSM is generic, language-agnostic, and portable, as it can be used to implement a great variety of dynamic languages. It is extensible, featuring built-in support for custom extension mechanisms. It is also high-performance, as it is designed to benefit from the optimizing compiler in the Truffle framework. Our initial evaluation indicates that the Truffle OSM can be used to implement high-performance language runtimes, with no performance overhead when compared to language-specific solutions.},

  abstract = {Runtime metaprogramming enables many useful applications and is often a convenient solution to solve problems in a generic way, which makes it widely used in frameworks, middleware, and domain-specific languages. However, powerful metaobject protocols are rarely supported and even common concepts such as reflective method invocation or dynamic proxies are not optimized. Solutions proposed in literature either restrict the metaprogramming capabilities or require application or library developers to apply performance improving techniques.
For overhead-free runtime metaprogramming, we demonstrate that dispatch chains, a generalized form of polymorphic inline caches common to self-optimizing interpreters, are a simple optimization at the language-implementation level. Our evaluation with self-optimizing interpreters shows that unrestricted metaobject protocols can be realized for the first time without runtime overhead, and that this optimization is applicable for just-in-time compilation of interpreters based on meta-tracing as well as partial evaluation. In this context, we also demonstrate that optimizing common reflective operations can lead to significant performance improvements for existing applications.},

  abstract = {Safepoints are a virtual machine mechanism that allows one thread
to suspend other threads in a known state so that runtime actions
can be performed without interruption and with data structures in a
consistent state. Many virtual machines use safepoints as a mechanism
to provide services such as stop-the-world garbage collection,
debugging, and modification to running code such as installing
or replacing classes. Languages implemented on these virtual machines
may have access to these services, but not directly to the
safepoint mechanism itself. We show that safepoints have many
useful applications for the implementation of guest languages running
on a virtual machine. We describe an API for using safepoints
in languages that were implemented under the Truffle language implementation
framework on the Java Virtual Machine and show
several applications of the API to implement useful guest-language
functionality. We present an efficient implementation of this API,
when running in combination with the Graal dynamic compiler. We
also demonstrate that our safepoints cause zero overhead with respect
to peak performance and statistically insignificant overhead
with respect to compilation time. We compare this to other techniques
that could be used to implement the same functionality and
demonstrate the large overhead that they incur.},

However, it remained unclear whether the approach works equally well in other dynamic languages. Furthermore, while PyPy is based on RPython, a language to write VMs with reusable components such as a tracing just-in-time compiler and garbage collection, the strategies design itself was not generalized to be reusable across languages implemented using that same toolchain. In this paper, we present a general design and implementation for storage strategies and show how they can be reused across different RPython-based languages. We evaluate the performance of our implementation for RSqueak, an RPython-based VM for Squeak/Smalltalk and show that storage strategies may indeed offer performance benefits for certain workloads in other dynamic programming languages.We furthermore evaluate the generality of our implementation by applying it to Topaz, a Ruby VM, and Pycket, a Racket implementation.},

  abstract = {We are in the multi-core era.
Dynamically-typed languages are in widespread use, but their support for
multithreading still lags behind. One of the reasons is that the sophisticated
techniques they use to efficiently represent their dynamic object models are
often unsafe in multithreaded environments.

This paper defines safety requirements for dynamic object models in
multithreaded environments.
Based on these requirements, a language-agnostic and thread-safe object model
is designed that maintains the efficiency of sequential approaches.
This is achieved by ensuring that field reads do not require synchronization
and field updates only need to synchronize on objects shared between threads.

Basing our work on JRuby+Truffle, we show that our safe object model has zero overhead on peak performance for thread-local objects
and only 3\% average overhead on parallel benchmarks where field updates require synchronization.
Thus, it can be a foundation for safe and efficient multithreaded VMs for a wide range of dynamic languages.},

  abstract = {Comparing the performance of programming languages is difficult because they differ in many aspects including preferred programming abstractions, available frameworks, and their runtime systems. Nonetheless, the question about relative performance comes up repeatedly in the research community, industry, and wider audience of enthusiasts.
This paper presents 14 benchmarks and a novel methodology to assess the compiler effectiveness across language implementations. Using a set of common language abstractions, the benchmarks are implemented in Java, JavaScript, Ruby, Crystal, Newspeak, and Smalltalk. We show that the benchmarks exhibit a wide range of characteristics using language-agnostic metrics. Using four different languages on top of the same compiler, we show that the benchmarks perform similarly and therefore allow for a comparison of compiler effectiveness across languages. Based on anecdotes, we argue that these benchmarks help language implementers to identify performance bugs and optimization potential by comparing to other language implementations.},

@article{Daloze:2018:TSC,
  abstract = {Dynamic programming languages such as Python and Ruby are widely used, and much effort is spent on making them efficient. One substantial research effort in this direction is the enabling of parallel code execution. While there has been significant progress, making dynamic collections efficient, scalable, and thread-safe is an open issue. Typical programs in dynamic languages use few but versatile collection types. Such collections are an important ingredient of dynamic environments, but are difficult to make safe, efficient, and scalable.
              In this paper, we propose an approach for efficient and concurrent collections by gradually increasing synchronization levels according to the dynamic needs of each collection instance. Collections reachable only by a single thread have no synchronization, arrays accessed in bounds have minimal synchronization, and for the general case, we adopt the Layout Lock paradigm and extend its design with a lightweight version that fits the setting of dynamic languages. We apply our approach to Ruby’s Array and Hash collections. Our experiments show that our approach has no overhead on single-threaded benchmarks, scales linearly for Array and Hash accesses, achieves the same scalability as Fortran and Java for classic parallel algorithms, and scales better than other Ruby implementations on Ruby workloads.},

@inproceedings{Roberts:2019:TTAF,
  abstract = {Transient gradual typing imposes run-time type tests that typically cause a linear slowdown. This performance impact discourages the use of type annotations because adding types to a program makes the program slower. A virtual machine can employ standard just-in-time optimizations to reduce the overhead of transient checks to near zero. These optimizations can give gradually-typed languages performance comparable to state-of-the-art dynamic languages, so programmers can add types to their code without affecting their programs' performance.},
